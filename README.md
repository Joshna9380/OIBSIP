# OIBSIP Retail Sales EDA (Oasis Infobyte Internship – Task 1)
# 🛒 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data

This project is part of my Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship (Task 1) 
The goal of this task is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a retail sales dataset to uncover meaningful insights, trends, and recommendations for business improvement.

## 📂 Project Overview

In this project, I worked on a retail dataset and performed:

- ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- ✅ Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation)  
- ✅ Time Series Analysis (Daily & Monthly Sales Trends)  
- ✅ Customer Analysis (Top Customers)  
- ✅ Product Analysis (Top Products & Heatmap)  
- ✅ Data Visualization (Bar charts, Line plots, Heatmaps)  
- ✅ Actionable Recommendations for business decisions  

## 📊 Dataset

  - The dataset contains retail transaction details such as:
  - **Date**: Invoice/Transaction Date  
  - **CustomerID**: Unique customer identifier  
  - **Product**: Product purchased  
  - **Quantity**: Number of items purchased  
  - **Price**: Price per unit  
  - **Sales**: Total sales (Quantity × Price)  

*(Dataset provided as part of internship tasks)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** → Data handling & cleaning  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** → Visualizations  
- **ReportLab** → PDF report generation  

## 📈 Key Insights

- Sales showed seasonal peaks in certain months.  
- Top customers contributed significantly to revenue (loyalty programs can be targeted).  
- Some products had consistently high demand, while others underperformed.  
- Business can optimize inventory & pricing using these insights.  

## 📑 Recommendations

1. Focus on promoting **top-selling products** during high-demand months.  
2. Provide **loyalty rewards** for top customers to improve retention.  
3. Identify **low-sales months** and run targeted marketing campaigns.  
4. Bundle or discount **underperforming products** to optimize inventory.  
5. Use **demand forecasting** to balance stock levels.  

## 📜 Report

- A detailed **EDA Report (PDF)** is generated with:
  - Descriptive Statistics  
  - Time Series Plots  
  - Top Customers & Products  
  - Heatmap Analysis  
  - Business Recommendations
